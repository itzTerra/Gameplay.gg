Please be cautious about sharing any personal or sensitive information in your submissions, as this information will be publicly accessible to other users.

### Additional User Data

In addition to user-submitted content, we also collect and store additional data connected to respective users. This data is used for the purpose of managing user permissions and to save usernames associated with the user accounts. This information helps us provide a personalized experience and enhance user interactions on our website.
