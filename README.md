# Gameplay.gg

> Community-driven gameplay database. Where **YOU** vote for the best game showcase.

**Tired of looking at random Youtube videos and skipping through the parts with no gameplay when deciding whether to play a game or not?** 
- On this site you can search for insightful gameplay clips easy and fast.

## *IN DEVELOPMENT*

### TODO
- support YT and Twitch clips
- make loading as async and parallel as possible, (e.g. load games on main page clips one by one instead of waiting for all of them and then show them)
- language tags for commentary/subtitles of clips
- karma system
- user management of suggested, approved or deleted clips
- like animation
- length (and views?) on videos
- better username blacklist
- game backgrounds, gradients
- i18n
- cookie banner
- SEO
- Lighthouse (quality & optimization checks)

### Made with
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (**Auth** and **Firestore**)
